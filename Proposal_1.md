## Problems
When going to a certain location, it is very inconvenient for users to find photographs of locations they wish to visit. Sometimes, they may not know if they really want to visit the place unless they see a picture of it first.

## Solution
Our solution is a location-based instagram, where artists can upload their professional photographs of locations. Users would be able to access these photos on a map interface, and sneak a peek of these places before visiting them. 

## Assumptions
One assumption is that these photographers and artists have taken photographs of these locations, and are willing to upload them onto the app, where everyone can access them. Another assumption is that users are willing to check photos of a place in a completely separate app. 

## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because ...

## Competitors
* Behance, by Adobe (but it's for categorical images, not location-based)
* Shotnote (but it's for sharing with friends, not the general public)
* EyeEm (but it's categorical)
